PyUFTPD
=======

Python implementation of UFTPD.

> *Work in progress!*

The Python version will "take over" from the Java implementation of
the server with version *3.0*

**Goals:**

 * every FTP session gets its own Python process
 * fully drop permissions to the current user
 * better Unix integration (profile, variable resolving etc)
