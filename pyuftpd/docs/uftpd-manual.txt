UNICORE UFTP
------------

UFTP is a data streaming library and file transfer tool. 

UFTP is best used using the 'uftp' client-side application (available
from https://sourceforge.net/projects/unicore/files/Clients/UFTP-Client),
but is easily integrated into custom applications due to its FTP
compliance.

It can be also integrated into UNICORE, allowing to transfer data from
client to server (and vice versa), as well as providing data staging
and third-party transfer between UFTP-enabled UNICORE sites.

A full UFTP server installation consists of two parts

 - the "uftpd" file server

 - either a UNICORE/X server, or a standalone authentication 
   service.

This manual covers the UFTP file server "uftpd".


UFTP features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - dynamic firewall port opening using passive FTP. UFTPD requires only 
   a single open port

 - optional multiple TCP streams per data connaction  
     Based on code from the JPARSS library, 
     Copyright (c) 2001 Southeastern Universities Research Association,
     Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility

 - optional encryption of the data streams using a symmetric key
   algorithm

 - optional compression of the data streams (using gzip)

 - command port protected by SSL

 - partial reads/writes to a file. If supported by the filesystem,
   multiple UFTP processes can thus read/write a file in parallel
   (striping)

 - standalone command line client available

 - supports third-party FTP clients such as 'curl' or 'ftp', 
   after getting a one-time password via the Auth server (RESTful API)

 - integrated into UNICORE clients for fast file upload and download

 - integrated with UNICORE servers for fast data staging and
   server-to-server file transfers

How does UFTP work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The UFTP file server, called 'uftpd', listens on two ports (which may be on
two different network interfaces):

 - the command port receives control commands

 - the listen port accepts data connections from clients.

The uftpd server is "controlled" (usually by UNICORE/X) via the
command port, and receives/sends data directly from/to a client
machine (which can be an actual user client machine or another
server). Data connnections are made to the "listen" port, which has to
be accessible from external machines. Firewalls have to treat the
"listen" port as an FTP port.

A UFTP file transfer works as follows:

 * the client (which can be an end-user client, or a service such as a UNICORE/X server)
   sends an authentication request to the Auth server (or another UNICORE/X server)
   
 * the Auth server sends a request to the command port of UFTPD.
   This request notifies the UFTPD server about the upcoming transfer and
   contains the following information 
  
    - a "secret", i.e. a one-time password which the client will use to
      authenticate itself
    - the user and group id which uftpd should use to access files
    - an optional key to encrypt/decrypt the data
    - the client's IP address
    
 * the UFTPD server will now  accept an incoming client connection, provided the 
   supplied "secret" (one-time password) matches the expectation.
 
 * if everything is OK, an FTP session is created, and the client can use the FTP
   protocol to open data connections, list files, transfer data etc.
   Data connections are opened via "passive FTP", which allows the firewall to dynamically
   open the requested ports (which can by any port, see below if you want to a 
   fixed port range).

 * for each UFTP session, UFTPD will fork a process which runs as the requested user (with the
   requested primary group)


[NOTE] .IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE
========================================================= 
The UNICORE UFTPD server is running with root privileges. Make sure to
read and understand the section below on protecting the command
socket.  Otherwise, users logged on to the UFTPD machine can possibly
read and write other user's files.
=========================================================

Installation and use
--------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Python 3.4.0 or later

  - the server's "listen" port needs to be accessible through your firewalls, 
    declaring it an "FTP" port (FTP connection tracking). Alternatively a fixed
    range of open ports can be configured and used
    
  - the server's command port needs to be accessible from the Auth server(s)

  - the UFTPD server needs access to the target file systems

  - a server certificate for the UFTPD server is STRONGLY recommended for
    production use (see the section on SSL below)


A functional UFTP installation requires either an Auth server or a 
full UNICORE/X server.


[NOTE]
.NOTE ON PATHS
=========================================================
The UNICORE UFTPD server is distributed either as a platform independent 
and portable tar.gz or zip bundle, or as an installable, platform dependent 
package such as RPM.

Depending on the installation package, the paths to various files 
are different. If installing using distribution-specific package 
the following paths are used:

  CONF=/etc/unicore/uftpd
  BIN=/usr/share/unicore/uftpd/bin
  LIB=/usr/share/unicore/uftpd/lib

If installing using the portable bundle, all UFTPD files are installed
under a single directory. Path prefixes are as follows, where INST 
is the directory where UFTPD was installed:

  CONF=INST/conf
  BIN=INST/bin
  LIB=INST/lib

These variables (CONF, BIN and LOG) are used throughout the rest of 
this manual.
=========================================================

Starting and stopping the UFTPD server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
If using the Linux packages, uftpd is integrated as a service via systemd, and
you can stop/start it via 'systemctl'. Also, logging is (by default) done via 
systemd, and you can look at the logs via 'journalctl'

To do things manually, you can use the start/stop and status scripts that are
provided in the BIN directory.

 - +unicore-uftpd-start.sh+ starts the server
 - +unicore-uftpd-stop.sh+ stops the server
 - +unicore-uftpd-status.sh+ checks the server status

The parameters such as server host/port, control host/port, and others are
configured in the +CONF/uftpd.conf+ file

In a production scenario with multiple users, the uftpd server
needs to be started as root. This is necessary to be able to
access files as the correct user/group and set correct file permissions.


Configuration parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following variables can be defined in the configuration file (uftpd.conf):

  SERVER_HOST     : the interface where the server listens for client data 
                    connections

  SERVER_PORT     : the port where the server listens for client data 
                    connections
                    
  ADVERTISE_HOST  : Advertise this server as having the following IP in the
                    control connection. This is useful if the server is behind
                    a NAT firewall and the public address is different from
                    SERVER_HOST.

  CMD_HOST        : the interface where the server listens for control commands

  CMD_PORT        : the port where the server listens for control commands

  SSL_CONF        : File containing SSL settings for the command port

  ACL             : File containing the list of server DNs that are allowed 
                    access to the command port 

  MAX_CONNECTIONS : the maximum number of concurrent control connections per client IP

  MAX_STREAMS     : the maximum number of parallel TCP streams per connection

  BUFFER_SIZE     : the size of the buffer (in kilobytes) for reading/writing local files

  PORT_RANGE      : (optional) server-side port range in the form 'lower:upper' that will be 
                    used for data connections. By default, any free ports will be used.
                    Example: set to '50000:50500' to limit the port range. 
		            NOTE ports in this range *must not* be used by other services!

  DISABLE_IP_CHECK : (optional) in some situations, the client IP can be different from
                     the one that was sent to the UFTPD server. This will lead to rejected
		             transfers. Setting this variable to a non-zero value will disable the
		             IP check. Only the one-time password will be checked.

  UFTP_KEYFILES    : (optional) list of files (relative to current user's $HOME) where uftpd will
                     read public keys for authentication. List is separated by ":". This defaults
		             to ".ssh/authorized_keys"

  UFTP_NO_WRITE    : (optional) ":"-separated list of file name patters that uftpd should
                     not write to

  LOG_VERBOSE      : set to 'true' to get (much) more detailed logging

  LOG_SYSLOG       : set to 'false' to print logging output to stdout

As usual if you set the SERVER_HOST to be "0.0.0.0", the server will bind to all the available 
network interfaces.

If possible, use an "internal" interface for the Command socket. If that
is not possible, make sure the Command socket is protected by a firewall!

We STRONGLY recommend enabling SSL for the Command socket. Please refer to the 
next section.

Protecting the Command socket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using SSL for the Command port ensures that only trusted parties
(i.e. trusted Auth and/or UNICORE/X servers) can issue commands to the 
UFTPD server. To further limit the set of trusted users, an access control
list (ACL) file is used.

In production settings where users can log in to the UFTPD server
machine, SSL MUST be enabled to prevent unauthorized data access!

[NOTE] .IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE
========================================================= 
Without SSL enabled, users logged in to the UFTPD server can
easily create exploits to read or write files with arbitrary
user privileges (except 'root').
=========================================================

SSL setup
^^^^^^^^^

To setup SSL, you need a PEM file containing the UFTPD server's
credential, and a PEM file containing certificate authorities that
should be trusted.

The following properties can be set in the +CONF/uftpd-ssl.conf+ file.

---------------
credential.path=path/to/keyfile.pem
credential.password=...

truststore=path/to/ca-cert-file.pem
---------------

If the +credential.path+ property is NOT set, SSL will be disabled.


[NOTE] .Backwards (in)compatibility to previous versions
========================================================= 
UFTPD 2.x SSL config is NOT supported
=========================================================


ACL setup
^^^^^^^^^

The access control list contains the distinguished names of those certificates that
should be allowed access.

The "ACL" setting in +CONF/uftpd.conf+ is used to specify the location of the ACL file

------------

export ACL=conf/uftpd.acl

-------------

The default ACL contains the certificate DN of the UNICORE/X server from the UNICORE 
core server bundle. In production, you need to replace this by the actual DNs of 
your UNICORE/X server(s) and UFTP Authentication server(s).

The ACL entries are expected in RFC2253 format. To get the name 
from a certificate in the correct format using openssl, you can use the 
following OpenSSL command:

   $> openssl x509 -in your_server.pem -noout -subject -nameopt RFC2253

The ACL file can be updated at runtime.

Firewall configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[NOTE]
====================================
Please consult the firewall documentation on how to 
enable an "FTP" service on your firewall (or operating system).
====================================

With Linux iptables, you may use rules similar to the following:

-------------
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport $SERVER_PORT -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m helper --helper ftp-$SERVER_PORT -j ACCEPT
-------------

where $SERVER_PORT is the SERVER_PORT defined in uftpd.conf. The first
rule allows anyone to access port $SERVER_PORT. The second rule
activates the iptables connection tracking FTP module on port
$SERVER_PORT.

On some operating systems it may be required to load additional kernel modules to
enable connection tracking, for example on CentOS:
------------
modprobe nf_conntrack_ipv4
modprobe nf_conntrack_ftp ports=$SERVER_PORT
------------


Logging
~~~~~~~

By default, UFTPD writes to syslog, and you can use 'journalctl' to read log messages.

To print logging output to stdout, set "export LOG_SYSLOG=false" in the +uftpd.conf+ file.


UNICORE Integration
-------------------

Please refer to the UNICORE/X manual for detailed information on how to configure 
UFTP based data access and data transfer.


Testing the UFTPD server
------------------------

You should use the 'uftp' client to run performance tests, which contains
many options such as the number of concurrent FTP connections, and can
use /dev/null and /dev/zero as data source/sink.
