#
# ACL file for the UFTPD
#
# This file must contain the distinguished names of those servers that
# want to initiate UFTP transfers, ie. usually your site's Auth
# and UNICORE/X servers  
#



# The ACL entries, one per line,  are expected in RFC2253 format.
# To get the name from a certificate in the correct format
# you can use the following OpenSSL command:
#
#   $> openssl x509 -in your_server.pem -noout -subject -nameopt RFC2253
#
# for example:
# CN=AUTH,O=UNICORE,C=EU
#
