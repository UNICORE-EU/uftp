# ACL file for the UFTPD
#
# This file must contain the distinguished names of those servers that
# want to initiate UFTP transfers, ie. usually your site's UNICORE/X servers  
# 
# The ACL entries are expected in RFC2253 format. To get the name 
# from a certificate in the correct format using openssl, you can use the 
# following OpenSSL command:
#
#   $> openssl x509 -in your_server.pem -noout -subject -nameopt RFC2253
#

#
# example entry: UNICORE/X demo certificate
#
@acl@
