====================
uftp bash completion
====================


Prerequisites
=============

You need to have the package "bash-completion" installed.


Installation
============


If bash completion is not automatically loaded on your machine,
or if you are unsure, add the following lines to your .bashrc:

  if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
      . /etc/bash_completion 
  fi


Add the following lines to your .bashrc:

  if [ -f ~/unicore/uftp_bash_completion.sh ]; then
      . ~/unicore/uftp_bash_completion.sh
  fi

Of course, change the lines so that they point to the correct location
of your ucc.bash_completion.sh.

If you now start a new shell, the completion for ucc options should
work, e.g. typing

  uftp in<TAB>

should complete to

  uftp info

etc.
