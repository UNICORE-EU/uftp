UNICORE UFTPD server
====================

UFTP (UNICORE File Transfer Protocol) is a high-performance data
transfer library based on passive FTP. This package contains
the 'uftpd' file server. For a full UFTP server installation, you will
additionally need either a full UNICORE server installation or the
more lightweight 'auth server' package.
